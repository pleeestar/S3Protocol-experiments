# Gossip-based Persona Formation

## 1. Introduction
Persona is treated not as a static vector but as a dynamic belief updated via decentralized gossip.

## 2. Model
Each node holds belief b_i.
Update rule:
b_i <- α_i b_i + (1-α_i) b_j

## 3. Experiment
Different α values represent personality rigidity.

## 4. Result
Beliefs converge, but trajectory depends on α distribution.

## 5. Discussion
Persona emerges as a morphism composition, not an object.

## 6. Future Work
Introduce semantic vectors and LLM-based belief transforms.
